## About The Project

<p>Pick-up line generator was a project for an elective during my education. It was created in collaboration with 2 classmates. The focus of the elective was to apply aquired knowledge in Rest API, Node.js, Express.js and MySQL database to create a functional product.</p>
<p>There was a low focus on interface part as the inportant aspect was the functionality. We created a simple home page with two types of Pick-up lines being generated, one random and one generated based on a chosen theme, and Sign up and Log in buttons for access to member profile. In this member profile the user can add, update and delete a pick-up line.</p>
